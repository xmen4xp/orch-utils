## Multi-Tenancy API Mapping Generator Tool

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

## Overview

Tenancy API Mapping is a cloud-native application on the Edge Orchestrator. It
provides a URI rewrite scheme that maps external-facing URIs with the internal
representation of those corresponding APIs, offering the following benefits:

- Exposes a multi-tenant, hierarchical API to external users, structured to
  comply with industry-standard API guidelines like Google API’s, AWS API, etc.

- Avoids the need for backend services to migrate the served APIs to roll this
  out to the user.  Instead, the remapping feature provides a path where the
  user benefits from the newer API immediately, without requiring backend
  changes as a prerequisite.

The APIs to be mapped are specified as configuration by the admin at
install/upgrade time through API remapping K8s CRD.  These CRs are expected to
be created/updated only at the time of install or upgrade and not changed at
runtime.

The Multi-Tenancy OpenAPI Specification Generator is a tool designed to
automate the generation of OpenAPI specifications for multi-tenant
environments. It streamlines the process by reading API mapping configurations,
cloning Git repositories, processing pre-generated OpenAPI specs, and producing
new specs that accommodate multi-tenant architectures.

## Get Started

Tenancy API Mapping gets deployed as a k8s job along with the deployment of
Edge Manageability Framework deployment. But user can also install Tenancy API
Mapping using the helm chart on their own k8s cluster using following command.

```shell
helm install -n orch-iam --create-namespace tenancy-api-mapping charts/tenancy-api-mapping
```

## Develop

Tenancy API Mapping is developed in the **Go** language and is built as a
Docker image through a `Dockerfile` in the `tenancy-api-mapping` folder. The CI
integration for this repository will publish the container image to the Edge
Orchestrator Release Service OCI registry upon merging to the `main` branch.

Tenancy API Mapping has a corresponding Helm chart in the
`charts/tenancy-api-mapping` folder. The CI integration for this repository
will publish this Helm chart to the Edge Orchestrator Release Service OCI
registry upon merging to the `main` branch. Tenancy API Mapping is deployed to
the Edge Orchestrator using this Helm chart, whose lifecycle is managed by Argo
CD (see [Foundational Platform]).

### Design Explanation

The tool functions by ingesting API mapping configuration resources (CRs) and a
dedicated `config.yaml` file.  It extracts Git repository details from the API
mapping CRs for each module, clones the repository, and accesses the
pre-generated OpenAPI spec from the path specified in the CR.

Subsequently, the tool processes each path in the OpenAPI spec in accordance
with the mappings defined in the API mapping CR, culminating in the generation
of a new OpenAPI spec designed for multi-tenancy.

### API Mapping Config CR

The API Mapping Config CR (Custom Resource) is a Kubernetes resource that
outlines the mappings and configurations essential for the generation of the
multi-tenancy OpenAPI spec.

#### Fields in the API Mapping Config CR

##### Metadata

- `name`: The unique name of the API Mapping Config CR, used to identify the
  resource within a Kubernetes namespace.

- `labels`: This is the standard Kubernetes labels field. A specific label
  mentioned below needs to be added in each new API Mapping CR.

   ```yaml
   configs.config.edge-orchestrator.intel.com: default
   ```

##### Spec

- `specGenEnabled`: A boolean indicating whether the generation of the OpenAPI
  spec is enabled.
- `repoConf`: Contains the Git repository configuration.
  - `url`: The URL of the Git repository containing the OpenAPI spec.
  - `tag`: The specific tag or branch to clone from the repository.
  - `specFilePath`: The relative file path to the OpenAPI spec within the
    repository.
- `mappings`: An array of mapping objects that correlate external URIs with
  service URIs.
  - `externalURI`: The new external URI to be used in the multi-tenancy OpenAPI
    spec.
  - `serviceURI`: The original service URI as defined in the pre-generated
    OpenAPI spec.
- `backend`: Specifies the backend service details where the API is hosted.
  - `service`: The Kubernetes service name.
  - `port`: The port on which the backend service is exposed.

### Tool's `config.yaml` Explanation

The `config.yaml` file specifies global settings for the tool:

- `localSubModsDir`: The directory for cloning repos (currently `repos`)
- `specOutputDir`: The directory where generated multi-tenancy OpenAPI specs
  are saved.
- `apimappingconfigcrsdir`: The directory containing the API mapping config
  CRs.
- `servers`: A list of server configurations to be included in the generated
  OpenAPI spec.

### Generating the Multi-Tenancy OpenAPI Spec

#### Step 1

##### Option A: Re-generate Using the Default Spec (base repo config and tag main)

1. Ensure the API mapping CRs are configured with the required APIMapping.

2. Check out the repos:

```shell
make checkout-repos
```

3. Run the tool using `make specgen`.

For Example:

- Verify the mapping CR for the 'metadata' service.

  ```shell
  ➜  foo@bar:~$ cat apimappingconfigcrs/amc-orch-metadata-broker-openapi.yaml

  apiVersion: apimappingconfig.edge-orchestrator.intel.com/v1
  kind: APIMappingConfig
  metadata:
    name: amc-orch-metadata-broker-openapi
    labels:
      configs.config.edge-orchestrator.intel.com: default
  spec:
    specGenEnabled: true
    repoConf:
      url: "https://github.com/open-edge-platform/orch-metadata-broker.git"
      tag: "v0.4.1"
      specFilePath: "api/spec/openapi.yaml"
    mappings:
      - externalURI: /v1/projects/{projectName}/metadata
        serviceURI: metadata.orchestrator.apis/v1/metadata
    backend:
      service: "metadata-broker-orch-metadata-broker-rest.orch-ui.svc.cluster.local"
      port: 9988
    ```

- Run the spec gen tool.

  ```shell
  ➜  foo@bar:~$    make specgen

  === about to process openapi spec from repo : https://github.com/open-edge-platform/orch-metadata-broker.git, file : api/spec/openapi.yaml
  about to process 1 paths from the existing openapi spec

  key to check : metadata.orchestrator.apis/v1/metadata
  about to process operation GET
  about to process operation POST
  about to process operation DELETE
  number of paths after process = 1
  number of entries in mapping cr = 1
  === completed processing openapi spec from repo : https://github.com/open-edge-platform/orch-metadata-broker.git, file : api/spec/openapi.yaml
  Created Multi-tenancy OpenAPI spec for repo: https://github.com/open-edge-platform/orch-metadata-broker.git
  ```

##### Option B: Change the Tag and Re-generate

1. Edit the API Mapping Config CR to change the tag field under repoConf to the
   desired tag.

  ```shell
    yq eval '.spec.repoConf.tag = "v0.4.1"' --inplace "apimappingconfigcrs/amc-orch-metadata-broker-openapi.yaml"
  ```

  Then verify the version was updated:

  ```shell
    ➜  foo@bar:~$ cat apimappingconfigcrs/amc-orch-metadata-broker-openapi.yaml
    apiVersion: apimappingconfig.edge-orchestrator.intel.com/v1
    kind: APIMappingConfig
    metadata:
      name: amc-orch-metadata-broker-openapi
      labels:
        configs.config.edge-orchestrator.intel.com: default
    spec:
      specGenEnabled: true
      repoConf:
        url: "https://github.com/open-edge-platform/orch-metadata-broker.git"
        tag: "v0.4.1"
        specFilePath: "api/spec/openapi.yaml"
      mappings:
        - externalURI: /v1/projects/{projectName}/metadata
          serviceURI: metadata.orchestrator.apis/v1/metadata
      backend:
        service: "metadata-broker-orch-metadata-broker-rest.orch-ui.svc.cluster.local"
        port: 9988
  ```

2. Check out the repos:

```shell
make checkout-repos
```

3. Run the tool using `make specgen`.

##### Note

- On running the spec-generator command, all the specs will be processed.
  In order for other specs to be ignored, they have to be marked 'specGenEnabled: false' in the mapping CR.
  For Example:

  ```shell
    yq eval '.spec.specGenEnabled = false' --inplace "apimappingconfigcrs/<mapping-file-name>"
  ```

#### Step 2

##### Where to Expect the Result

The resulting multi-tenancy OpenAPI specs will be located in the
`openapispecs/generated` directory as defined in the `config.yaml` file.

#### Step 3

##### Git Commit

Commit the following changes to the tool's Git repository:

1. The configured API mapping CRs.
2. The newly generated multi-tenancy OpenAPI specs.
3. The incremented version in the `VERSION` file.

#### Step 4

##### Propagating Changes to Orchestrated Deployment

To propagate the changes:

1. Update the relevant version in the `Chart.yaml` file in the
   'orch-utils/tenancy-api-mapping' folder for 'tenancy-api-mapping'.
   <https://github.com/open-edge-platform/orch-utils/blob/main/charts/tenancy-api-mapping/Chart.yaml#L10>

2. Increment the version for the 'orch-utils/tenancy-api-mapping' Helm chart.
   <https://github.com/open-edge-platform/orch-utils/blob/main/charts/tenancy-api-mapping/Chart.yaml#L09>

3. After merging, use this 'orch-utils/tenancy-api-mapping' chart version in
   the Open Edge Platform installation.

### Next Steps

For consumers of these OpenAPI specs:

1. Utilize the provided OpenAPI specs to generate the corresponding UI code.
2. Generate the appropriate tag for deployment.

This documentation offers a detailed guide for users to effectively leverage
the Multi-Tenancy OpenAPI Specification Generator tool, covering all necessary
steps from initial setup to deployment.

### To Generate the Combined Open API Spec

```shell
make specgen
make convert-and-combine
make clean-intermediate
```

This target generates the unified OpenAPI spec for all the service API specs
and the Datamodel API spec.

The spec for the service APIs will get pulled from the configs provided in the
`apimappingconfigcrs/` path.

Whereas the Datamodel spec is copied directly from the repo. There is a
provision to mention the tag version in the makefile.  `DM_REPO_TAG_VERSION` to
specify the version of the spec file to be copied.
